# Automation Challenge
This project is a hands-on practice framework using Cypress for end-to-end testing of a sample web application.

This Challenge consists in two parts:

#### 1. UI automation for the important test cases in [www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

These test cases are:

1. Login with valid credentials 
2. Login with invalid password
3. Login with lockedout user
4. Add product to cart
5. Remove product to cart
6. Add multiple products to cart
7. Remove multiple products to cart
8. Sort products ascending by name
9. Sort products descending by name
10. Sort products ascending by price
11. Sort products descending by price
12. Checkout a product
13. Checkout multiple product


## Tools and technologies

* Javascript
* Cypress.io
* Mochawsome Report
* Github Actions

## How to run the tests locally

### General Requirements

#### Dependencies

1. Make sure you have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.

### Dev Install

* Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### How To Use Cypress

The following commands can be used in order to run the test cases

**Open Cypress Test Runnner**

 Use the command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

or the custom command

```bash
npm run cy:open
```

**Run Electron Headless**

 Use the command:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

or the custom command

Run the tests on headless mode (Mochawsome reports will be generated by running the tests this way). Type on the terminal:

```bash
npm run cy:run
```

### Contributing


Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch
3. Commit your Changes
4. Push to the Branch 
5. Open a Pull Request

#### Writing tests

##### Test Structure
* `it()`: It is used to define an specific test case.
* `describe()`: It is used to group some test cases that are related to an specific feature or behavior.
* `context()`: It is used to group all the test cases of an specific E2E or file.

For any additional info on how to write tests, read [this article](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests) from Cypress.

##### POM pattern
The design pattern is a combianation of POM and the best cypress practices.

Add getters and methods to the the Page Object class, for example:

```javascript 
export default class LoginPage {

 get usernameInput() { return '#user-name'; }

 inputUsername(username) {
    return this.usernameInput().type(username);
  }
}
```

Write methods on the Page Object class to call them on the test, for example:


```javascript 

  login(username, password) {
    this.inputUsername(username);
    this.inputPassword(password);
    this.clickLoginButton();
}
```

Than call them from the it() step on your feature scenario (*describe()*) for cleaner code:

```javascript
 it('Login', () => {
    productPage.login(this.data.username, this.data.password);
   
  });
```

##### Cypress Custom Commands

In Cypress is possible to create [Custom Commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) to be used in the test. To create or edit a custom command, go to `support/commands.js` and add the code. E.g:

```javascript 
Cypress.Commands.add('clickForce', (selector) => {
    cy.get(selector).click({force: true});
})
```

### Engineering Standards

There are standards established for  Test Automation. Here's a list that of some standards that we should follow for all our automation work:

* [Basics](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices)
* [Coding Standards](https://betterprogramming.pub/8-best-practices-for-future-proofing-your-typescript-code-2600fb7d8063)
* [Git and PR Standards](https://sourcelevel.io/blog/7-git-best-practices-to-start-using-in-your-next-commit)
* [Git Guide](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* [Design Pattern](https://www.toolsqa.com/cypress/page-object-pattern-in-cypress/)

### Formatting

* Use semicolons.
* Use const for declaring elements.
* No more than 150 characters on a single line.
* No trailing white spaces.
* Opening braces go on the same line.
* Use single quotes.
* Do not use var for declaring variables.
* Declare one variable per let statement.
* Do not comment out unused code. Remove it if is not needed / used.
* For single line comments, use `// This is a comment`.
* For Multiline comments, use: 

### Naming Conventions

* Use `lowerCamelCase` for _variables_, _properties_, _functions_ and _constants_ names.
* Use `PascalCase` for class files
